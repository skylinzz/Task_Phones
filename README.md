Hello, welcome to my instalation guide.

First of all you will need to install PHP version 7.4 or higher. 

You can download PHP from here: https://www.php.net/downloads.php

You will also need some kind ouf web server, if you do not have one, i recomend apache.
You can download apache from here:https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

Now all you need to do is download my project to your localhost directory(the directory may change depending on what webserver you are using).

Now you can simply open my project on your browser.


You can also find the requested screenshots under the screenshots directory.

Thank you for your time.
